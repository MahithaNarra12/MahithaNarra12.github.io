# Static Website Hosted on GitHub Pages

This repository hosts a simple static website deployed using GitHub Pages. The site is served directly from this repository and is publicly accessible at:

**https://<MahithaNarra12>.github.io**

---

## Deployment Steps (Manual via GitHub)

1. **Create Repository**  
   - Created a new public GitHub repository named `<yourusername>.github.io`.  
   - This naming convention enables GitHub Pages to serve the site at the URL above.

2. **Upload Website Files**  
   - Uploaded static website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) directly via the GitHub web interface.  
   - Files include `index.html` as the main entry point, along with any necessary assets.

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**  
   - Navigated to the repository's **Settings** tab.  
   - Under **Pages**, selected the **main** branch and the root directory (`/`) as the source.  
   - Saved the settings to activate GitHub Pages hosting.

4. **Access the Live Site**  
   - Waited a few minutes for GitHub to process and publish the site.  
   - Opened the URL `https://<yourusername>.github.io` in a browser to verify the website is live.

5. **Updating the Site**  
   - To update the site, uploaded updated or new files manually via GitHub.  
   - Changes automatically reflected after a short delay.

## Outcome

- Learned how to use GitHub as a version control system for static web projects.  
- Gained experience in deploying and hosting static content using GitHub Pages.  
- Created a publicly accessible personal or project portfolio website with zero hosting cost.

---

## Notes

- This method is suitable for simple static sites without server-side processing.  
- For version control and collaboration, using Git CLI or GitHub Desktop with commits and pushes is recommended.
